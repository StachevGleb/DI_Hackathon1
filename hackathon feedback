Card matching game.
First of all I love your video expalining the project !
Very good and shows that you know what you are doing, and maybe even enjoy it?!
Your global variable decleration at the beggining of the script is a good idea.
Using DOM manipulation to set backgrounds, flipping cards, general styling and rendering the cards is excellent!!
Your functions, scope understanding, events; all show the knowlege you've gained the past few months!
Congrats on an EXCELLENT project!
